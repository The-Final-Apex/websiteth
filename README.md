Okay, got it. Here's how to run a Flask app:

## Running a Flask App

Assuming you have a Flask app already set up, here's how you can run it:

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt**: Navigate to the directory where your Flask app is located.

2. **Install Flask**: If you haven't already, install the Flask library by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install flask
   ```

3. **Run the Flask app**: In your terminal, execute the following command to start the Flask development server:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

   Replace `app.py` with the name of your Flask app's main file (e.g., `main.py`, `server.py`, etc.).

4. **Access the app**: Once the server is running, you can access your Flask app by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000/`. This is the default URL for a Flask app running in development mode.

That's it! The Flask development server will start running, and you can access your app in the browser.

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. **Opening a terminal**: You need to have a terminal or command prompt open to run the Flask app.
2. **Installing Flask**: If you haven't already installed the Flask library, you need to do so using the `pip install flask` command.
3. **Running the app**: The `python app.py` command tells the Python interpreter to execute the `app.py` file, which contains your Flask app's code.
4. **Accessing the app**: Once the server is running, you can open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000/` to see your Flask app in action.

Remember, the Flask development server is meant for local development and testing. For production deployments, you should use a more robust server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.


Sure, here's the Python installation guide for different operating systems:

## Installing Python

Python is available for all major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Here's how you can install Python on each platform:

### Windows

1. Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for Windows.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Python.
3. Make sure to select the option to add Python to your system's PATH during the installation process.

### macOS

1. Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for macOS.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Python.

### Linux

The process for installing Python on Linux varies depending on your distribution. Generally, you can use your distribution's package manager to install Python. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run the following command in your terminal:
But python is commonly installed on most Linux distros on installation
```
sudo apt-get install python3
```

On other Linux distributions, the command may differ. For example, on CentOS/RHEL, you can use:

```
sudo yum install python3
```

On Arch Linux, you can use:

```
sudo pacman -S python
```

Make sure to replace `python3` or `python` with the appropriate version of Python you want to install.

After installing Python, you can verify the installation by opening a terminal and typing:

```
python --version
```

This should display the installed version of Python.

Now that you have Python installed, you can proceed with running your Flask app.

For this project specifically run python main.py
